The project integrates mechanical and electrical design, incorporating a robot arm, a microcontroller, sensors, and actuators. The sorting machine uses color identification to sort wooden blocks of three different colors. The blocks are stacked and dropped onto a conveyor belt by a hopper system that employs a solenoid actuator and a servo to release one block at a time at specific intervals. As the belt runs continuously, each block passes under a color sensor, which monitors the color and signals one of three servo-powered mechanical arms to guide the block into the appropriate chute. Each chute is equipped with a capacitive proximity sensor that sends a voltage signal to the robot controller, queuing commands for the robot to pick up the blocks from the bottom of each chute and return them to the hopper to form a continuously running sorting system. The project exemplifies a low-cost system that can be used in mechatronics education to illustrate the many challenges encountered in developing automated sorting systems.
